## Part 2 ST10479777
## Overview
In Part 2 I created CSS designs that are responssive across all mobile screens. The goal was to practice advanced CSS without relying on images while ensuring accessiblility and responsiveness
## Features
- External images
- Responsive design on tables, desktops and cell phones
- Grid layout of images to display responsiveness
## Technology Used
- Visual Studio
## Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge:** some images did not always scale correctly pixel (px)
- **Solution:** I adjusted sizing by combining percentages (%) with pixels (px)
- **Challenge:** Maintaining responsiveness while keeping the images and texts aligned
- **Solution:** I used relative units like (% and widths) along with max-width and height.
## Part 1 Corrections:
**Analysis:**

Its purpose is to provide important information to its customers such as the menu, location and times. The target audience is young professionals and students who want a meal and a quick coffee to start their day on a high. The website is user-friendly with buttons and images. Overall the website follows the brands goals and objectives.
**Budget:**
